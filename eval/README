How to evaluate a new library?

Let N be the number of parallel jobs to execute. Unless otherwise
stated, execute all commands in the eval/ directory.

1. Place the library sources in the problems/ directory (possibly with
   subdirectories). The sources should contain *.v and *.glob files. If
   *.glob files are not present, they may be generated by compiling the
   *.v files with "make -k -j N init" in the eval directory.

2. cd tools && make

3. The program tools/coqnames may be used to insert calls to
   "hammer_hook" in the library source files (it requires the
   corresponding *.glob files to be present). Run it in the LIBSRCDIR
   directory. After running tools/coqnames you may need to edit some
   files manually to make them compile with coqc.

4. make -k -j N atp

5. atp/run-provers.sh [your.mail@mail.com]

   This script should be edited when adding or changing the (versions
   of) ATP provers used in the evaluation.

6. make -k -j N reconstr
