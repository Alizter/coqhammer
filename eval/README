How to evaluate a new Coq library?
==================================

Let N be the number of parallel jobs to execute. Unless otherwise
stated, execute all commands in the eval/ directory.

1. Place the library sources in the problems/ directory (possibly with
   subdirectories). The sources should contain *.v and *.glob files. If
   *.glob files are not present, they may be generated by compiling the
   *.v files with "make -k -j N init" in the eval directory.

2. cd tools && make

3. The program tools/coqnames may be used to insert calls to
   "hammer_hook" in the library source files (it requires the
   corresponding *.glob files to be present). Run it in the problems/
   directory. After running tools/coqnames you may need to edit some
   files manually to make them compile with coqc.

4. make -k -j N atp

5. cd atp && ./run-provers.sh [your.mail@mail.com]

   The script atp/run-provers.sh should be edited when adding or
   changing the (versions of) ATP provers used in the evaluation.

6. make -k -j N reconstr

After executing these steps, the reconstruction results are in the
out/ directory. The ATP results are in the atp/o/ directory.

Tools
-----

* `stat`: compute ATP statistics. Run in the atp/ directory. Reads the
  o/*/*.p files.

  Example: `tools/stat , y,p , , false`

stat takes 5 space-separated arguments: 4 lists (comma-separated
values; empty list is represented by a single comma) and a boolean

stat [labels] [sorting specification] [which fields to merge]
     [greedy sequence fixed start]
     (should different versions of the greedy sequence be computed?)

y - the number of proved theorems
n - the number of countersatisfiable problems
p - the prover
